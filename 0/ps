# ps = process status

# There are 3 types of options:
# BSD options:       no dash
# UNIX options:      preceded by a dash
# GNU long options:  preceded by two dashes

# The columns are:
# ProcessID, TerminalType, CPU Time (Has been running), Command
# PID TTY TIME CMD

# Basic flags
ps    # To list the processes of current shell
ps -e # To list all processes (identical to -A)
ps -r # To list all processes running
ps -x # To list all processes owned by you, i.e same EUID as ps (runner of the ps command)
ps -d # To list all processes, except session leaders
ps -T # To list all processes associated with a terminal
ps -a # To list all processes associated with a terminal, except session leaders

## -N or --deselect : negates the condition
ps -N  # processes not of current shell
ps -aN # processes, not associated with a terminal, or session leaders

## Note: session leaders is a process which kicks off other processes

# Select processes
## all can be a space-delimited list
ps -C command
ps -G group                  # group_name or group_id
ps -g group                  # group_name (or session if the list is completely numeric)
ps -p process_id             # or `ps p process_id` / `ps --pid process_id`
ps --ppid parent_process_id
ps -s session_id
ps -t tty                    # or `ps t tty` / `ps --tty tty`
ps -u user                   # user ID (EUID) or name, identical to -u and --user
ps -U user                   # user ID (RUID) or name

# format
ps -f ...    # full format
ps -F ...    # Extra full format
ps -o pid,user,command # user-defined format, equivalent to `ps o`, `ps --format`

# others (BSD)
ps aux  # equivalent to `ps -ef`
ps axjf # To list a process tree
