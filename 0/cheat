# To view a cheatsheet:
cheat tar      # a "top-level" cheatsheet
cheat foo/bar  # a "nested" cheatsheet

# To edit a cheatsheet:
cheat -e tar     # opens the "tar" cheatsheet for editing, or creates it if it does not exist
cheat -e foo/bar # nested cheatsheets are accessed like this

# To view the configured cheatpaths:
cheat -d

# To list all available cheatsheets:
cheat -l

# To list all cheatsheets that are tagged with "networking":
cheat -l -t networking

# To list all cheatsheets on the "personal" path:
cheat -l -p personal

# To search for the phrase "ssh" among cheatsheets:
cheat -s ssh

# To search (by regex) for cheatsheets that contain an IP address:
cheat -r -s '(?:[0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}'

# Flags may be combined in intuitive ways. Example: to search sheets on the
# "personal" cheatpath that are tagged with "networking" and match a regex:
cheat -p personal -t networking --regex -s '(?:[0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}'
