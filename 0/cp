# To copy a file / multiple files to a destination 
# Note: if dest is an existing directory, the src will be copied into that directory
cp [src1] [src2] ...  [dest]

# Copy a directory recursively
cp -r [src] [dest]

# Copy a file:
# 1. Do not override any existing file
# 2. Prompt if going to override any existing file
cp -n ...
cp -i ...                  # -i, --interactive

# Copy a file in verbose mode
cp -v ...

# To create a backup file with date:
cp foo.txt{,."$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"}

# To copy a symlink that points to a directory (and is thus soft) and not
# 'expand' the symlink (aka, preserve its nature as a symlink):
# Note this does NOT work (note trailing '/'):  cp -P /path/to/symlink-dir/
cp -P <symlink-dir> <dest-dir>
