# To create nested directories:
# To create foo/bar and foo/baz directories:
# To create the foo/bar, foo/baz, foo/baz/zip and foo/baz/zap directories:
mkdir -p foo/bar/baz
mkdir -p foo/{bar,baz}
mkdir -p foo/{bar,baz/{zip,zap}}
# If there is already an existing dir there, don't show error. (The command does nothing then)
# If the parent dir required does not exist, create it.
# For example, when we create `1/2` where `1` does not exist, 1 is then created automatically

# To create directory with file mode 777 (as in chmod)
mkdir -m 777 [dir]
